    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>Prodi<b>Gals</b> United is a faith-based nonprofit founded in 2025 to foster Christ-centered sisterhood and
      healing within local communities. Our stories typically connect to other lost sheep that can’t find light within
      the Church to do life alongside. We create an environment where women can come together to seek and encounter a
      God who loves them. We learn about the God that created us and the Brother he sent to save us from the trenches we
      find ourselves entangled in.</p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Prodi<b>Gals</b> connections focus on intertwining personal healing and sisterhood through the unity of Christ
      while learning about God’s promises for us. Inspired by the way Jesus honored and revealed himself to women,
      ProdiGals United welcomes all who are ready to return home and deepen their relationship and understanding of God.
    </p>
    <p>Entering the world purely through the Virgin Mary, and revealing himself first to the stained Mary Magdalene
      following his resurrection opens the door for women to find their place in God’s story when we are ready to return
      home.</p>
